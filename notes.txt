probability of random spot being chosen for protest is dependent on grievance of social media users
if multiple centroids pick closets centroid
time of a centroid existing is a slider

grievance of social media using agents should be dependent on the grievance levels of other social media users

random movement 1: as in original model
random movement 2: more realistic, no teleportation

(less bumping and blocking each other: is it possible to allow two agents to stand on one patch?)

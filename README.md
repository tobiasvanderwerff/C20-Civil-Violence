# C20-Civil-Violence

In this project we extend a model of civil unrest initially developed by Epstein (2002) to test hypotheses about the effects of social media on the emergence of riots.
To do this we extend an adaptation of Epstein's model that is part of the Netlogo standard library.
The implementation follows the multi-agent systems (MAS) paradigm.
